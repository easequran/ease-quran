    question: "Is online Quran learning safe for my child?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Parents are welcome to sit in on any class, classes may be recorded by parents, and there is no private teacher–student contact outside scheduled sessions. Female teachers are available for girls on request, and every teacher is credential-verified. See our Child Safety & Parent Rights Policy for full details.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I find a Quran teacher near me in Seattle?",
    answer:
      "Yes. While we are not a physical school in Seattle, our online Quran academy works for any family across the metro searching for a Quran teacher, Quran classes, or a Hifz program near them. You connect one-on-one with a certified teacher over Zoom from home, so a bridge crossing or a parking spot downtown is never part of the equation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve Seattle's tech industry and East African families?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Seattle's Muslim community is shaped in large part by the tech industry, with a significant South Asian workforce at companies across the Eastside, alongside a well-established East African community, particularly Somali and Ethiopian families, concentrated around South Seattle, Tukwila, and Kent. We welcome every family regardless of background, and all instruction is in clear, simple English.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can classes work around unpredictable tech industry hours?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A huge share of Seattle's Muslim parents work in tech, where on-call rotations, sprint deadlines, and last-minute business travel are simply part of the job. A fixed weekly class at a physical center rarely survives that kind of schedule. Online classes are easy to reschedule around a demanding week, and we work in Pacific Time to keep things simple.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are teachers certified from recognized Islamic institutions?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every Ease Quran teacher holds a recognized Quran qualification. This is not a casual credential, it represents years of rigorous academic study in Quran, Tajweed, Arabic, and Islamic sciences. Seattle-area Muslim families can have full confidence in our teachers' qualifications.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a female Quran teacher for sisters in Seattle?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Ask for a female teacher when you book the free trial, and we can arrange one at most times. The trial and every regular class are then taught by a female teacher.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve families across Bellevue, Redmond, and the Eastside?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We serve the entire Seattle metropolitan area, including Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Issaquah, Tukwila, and Kent. Since every class is conducted online via Zoom, it makes no difference whether your family is downtown, across Lake Washington, or south near the airport.",

              Seattle's Muslim Community

              A Tech-Driven, East African, and South Asian Muslim Community

            <div className="space-y-5 text-grey leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                Seattle's Muslim community is shaped by two distinct forces. On one side is the tech industry, which has drawn a large South Asian Muslim workforce, engineers and professionals from Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh who work at the region's major employers spread across Seattle and the Eastside. On the other is a long-established and vibrant East African Muslim community, particularly Somali and Ethiopian families, concentrated around South Seattle, Tukwila, and Kent, with mosques and community centers that have served the area for decades. Add a smaller but active convert community drawn to the Pacific Northwest's independent, questioning culture, and Seattle ends up with one of the more distinctly layered Muslim populations in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                The practical challenge for Seattle families is twofold: geography and schedule. Lake Washington splits the metro in half, and getting from the Eastside to a masjid in South Seattle, or the reverse, means crossing the 520 bridge or I-90, both notorious for slow, unpredictable traffic. Layer on top of that the tech industry's culture of on-call rotations, sprint deadlines, and frequent business travel, and a fixed weekly class at a set time in a set building becomes genuinely hard to commit to. Online Quran classes remove both problems at once. No bridge to cross, and a schedule that bends around a demanding job instead of competing with it.

                  Crossing 520 or I-90 to reach a masjid on the other side of Lake Washington eats up your evening before class even starts. Online classes remove the bridge entirely. Your child opens Zoom at home, and the lesson begins on time.
