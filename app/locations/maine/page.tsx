                Maine's Muslim community is small, centered mostly around Portland, with families spread across a large, rural state where the nearest mosque can be a genuine drive away. We don't have a physical school in Maine, and we won't pretend otherwise, but online Quran education closes exactly this kind of gap. A certified teacher meets your child over Zoom no matter how far your Maine town is from Portland.
